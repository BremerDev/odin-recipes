Objective:
Create a recipe website with multiple links to different recipes.

Key Notes:
Understand it may not look pretty.

Conclusion:
Pretty straight forward website. HTML only. Headers for important text portions (titles). I probably would have just used a paragraph tag for the description instead of a header. Good practice for adding images, linking webpages, using lists, and keeping consistant structure.

All in all an enjoyable experience. Great for beginners.
